#🎬 IMDB Sentiment Classifier (Machine Learning Project)
This project is a machine learning model that classifies movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either positive or negative.
Built from scratch using TF-IDF and Random Forest, with full control over the feature extraction and model pipeline.

🧠 Tech Stack
-Python

-Scikit-learn

-Pandas / NumPy

-TfidfVectorizer

-RandomForestClassifier

-Google Colab (for running)

#Detail
This code still has some parts that might not be optimized. There may be overfitting or inefficient data processing.
But if you're learning like me, feel free to study both the good and bad.
And if you already know this stuff — please teach me! That would be awesome 🙏

##🛠️ How to Run
Download the dataset from IMDB Dataset

Save it as IMDB Dataset.csv in the same folder as the script

Run the script in Google Colab or Jupyter

When prompted, type in any movie review — it will predict if it's positive or negative 🎯

This is my first NLP project.
I've been learning machine learning for 2 months now, and I don’t know how much is right or wrong.
If you have any advice or suggestions, I would really appreciate it 🙌

#🎯 My Big Dream
I’m 19, and my dream is to build AGI to help the world.
This project is the first step. I’ll keep learning, building, and sharing everything —
from zero to changing the world.
